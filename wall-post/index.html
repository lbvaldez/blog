          <h2>Starry Night Feature Wall</h2>
          <h3>May 1, 2020</h3>
          <img class="post-picture" src="../img/star-wall.jpg">
          <h3>Step 1: Gather Materials</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>I found the star decals on Etsy.  And though I bought the cheapest I could find, I was happy with the quality.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Step 2: Remove decals and stick to wall</h3>
          <p>Peeling the decals off the paper is pretty straight forward, but do be careful to peel them evenly or they will rip.
            The directions included were more complicated than they needed to be for a decal this small, just peel them off and stick them on the wall.
            I started with the largest stars, and tried to be random with the pattern.
            This is about a foot of space from the top to the bottom of the last row.
            I used all the large stars for this step.
            At this point, I thought it would be a good idea to put tape on the wall for reference, since I wanted only small stars at the bottom.
            I then put medium sized stars in a random pattern, filling in the space between big stars.
            I used stars sparingly at this point, and then came back after the next step to fill in more space, to make sure I had enough stars.
            I used about 12 stars for this step. I then added medium sized stars to the space between the large stars and the first piece of tape, which is about 2 ft from the top of the wall.
            I used about 35 stars for this step, and then used the rest to fill in more space at the top of the wall.
            I then added small stars to the bottom of wall.</p>
